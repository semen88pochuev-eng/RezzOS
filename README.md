## About the system


| Component | Recommended version |
|-----------|---------------------:|
| Linux     | 6.6.40 (LTS)        |
| BusyBox   | 1.36.1              |
| Bash      | 5.2                 |
| musl      | 1.2.5               |
| runit     | 2.1.2               |

> Change versions in <code>build.sh</code> if you need to build different versions.

## Features
- Package manager (Alpine repositories)
- Persistent storage (ext4)
- Network with DHCP and DNS
- Built-in diagnostics: `rezzdoctor` checks storage, services, network and memory, and reports what is wrong
- Lightweight and fast development environment: TCC and Lua in the root filesystem

## RezzUtils
Built-in utilities for convenient work:

- rezzpad — a simple text notepad
- rezztop — a system resource monitor
- rezzview — an image viewer

Sources and package list: [Rezz-utils source](https://github.com/stars/neko-qt/lists/rezz-utils)

## Installation on hardware
For execution in RAM(default):
- Download the ISO image.
- Save it to a flash drive.
- And boot from it.

For loading from disk:
- Follow the steps outlined above.
- After starting the system, enter these command:
```bash
rezzinstall
```

## Building from source
The simplest way is to use the included build script:

```bash
./build.sh
```

For NixOS use:

```bash
./nixshell-run.sh
```

Before building, install dependencies (list in <code>/docs/build dependencies.md</code>).
The script will automatically download sources, compile the kernel and BusyBox, assemble the rootfs, and create a disk image.

---

## Network
If you are using QEMU (virtual machine), you can configure the network manually:

```bash
ifconfig eth0 10.0.2.15 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
route add default gw 10.0.2.2
echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf
```

On real hardware DHCP is used. If the network does not come up:

```bash
dhcpcd eth0
```

Before using the package manager run:

```bash
pkg update
```

---

## Quick start (in QEMU)
Run from the repository root:

```bash
./start.sh        # text mode
./start-gui.sh    # with GUI (if built)
```
